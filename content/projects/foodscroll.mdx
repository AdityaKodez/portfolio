A demo showcasing infinite scroll with automatic content loading. Uses TanStack React Query's useInfiniteQuery hook for cursor-based pagination.

The Intersection Observer API detects when users reach the bottom, triggering the next page fetch. Includes skeleton loading states and dark mode support.

Mock data generated with Faker.js demonstrates smooth pagination of 100 items in 10-item chunks.
