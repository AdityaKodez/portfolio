A CLI tool that simplifies database operations by auto-detecting your ORM setup. Interactive menus for executing common commands without memorizing syntax.

Supports Prisma (push, generate, pull, validate, format, studio, migrate) and Drizzle (generate, migrate, push, pull, studio).

Detects config files automatically with manual selection fallback. Built with Bun runtime.
