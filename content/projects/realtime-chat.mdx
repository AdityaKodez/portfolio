Ephemeral chat rooms that self-destruct after a set duration. Real-time messaging with nameless users via randomized identities.

Rooms feature countdown timers showing time until auto-deletion, with manual delete option. Dark/light theme support.

Perfect for quick, private conversations without accounts or persistent history.
